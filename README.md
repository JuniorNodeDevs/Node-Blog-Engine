Node Blog Engine is my second attempt at writing a blog engine in Node.js.  This isn't intended for production use - just some fun to keep my skills sharp.

Road Map

 - Create a halfway-decent post editor
   - Real-time Markdown (done)
   - Word usage analyzer ( https://github.com/SomeKittens/commonality ) (done)
   - Suggest alternate words/phrases
 - Create a simple ORM to save the articles to some DB
 - Create a rendering engine that creates `.html` files from saved
 - Some way to actually display the articles?
 - Tag system
